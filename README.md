# InstaMock — Instagram-like Home Page Mock

This is a small static mock of an Instagram-style home feed built for demo and UI prototyping.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main HTML
- `styles.css` — styling and responsive layout
- `script.js` — small interactivity (like toggles)

To view:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or "Open with" your browser).

No server required — static files only.

Notes / next steps:

- Replace placeholder SVGs with real images or remote image URLs.
- Add more interactions (comments modal, story viewer) as needed.
